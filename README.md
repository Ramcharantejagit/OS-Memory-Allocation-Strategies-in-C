# OS-Memory-Allocation-Strategies-in-C-First-Fit-Best-Fit-and-Worst-Fit
This C program simulates three classical memory allocation strategies: First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit. 
It allows users to input memory block sizes and process sizes, then choose an allocation strategy to see how memory is allocated. The program reports which processes were allocated to which blocks and the remaining memory in each block after allocation.
Features:
Dynamic input for memory blocks and processes
Supports:
First Fit allocation
Best Fit allocation
Worst Fit allocation
Tracks allocated and remaining memory
Clear console output for results and allocation status.
